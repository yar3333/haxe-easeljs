/**
 * A Bitmap represents an Image, Canvas, or Video in the display list. A Bitmap can be instantiated using an existing
 * HTML element, or a string.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 * 	var bitmap = new createjs.Bitmap("imagePath.jpg");
 * 
 * <strong>Notes:</strong>
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>When using a video source that may loop or seek, use a {{#crossLink "VideoBuffer"}}{{/crossLink}} object to
 * 	 prevent blinking / flashing.
 * 	<li>When a string path or image tag that is not yet loaded is used, the stage may need to be redrawn before it
 * 	 will be displayed.</li>
 * 	<li>Bitmaps with an SVG source currently will not respect an alpha value other than 0 or 1. To get around this,
 * 	the Bitmap can be cached.</li>
 * 	<li>Bitmaps with an SVG source will taint the canvas with cross-origin data, which prevents interactivity. This
 * 	happens in all browsers except recent Firefox builds.</li>
 * 	<li>Images loaded cross-origin will throw cross-origin security errors when interacted with using a mouse, using
 * 	methods such as `getObjectUnderPoint`, or using filters, or caching. You can get around this by setting
 * 	`crossOrigin` flags on your images before passing them to EaselJS, eg: `img.crossOrigin="Anonymous";`</li>
 * </ol>
