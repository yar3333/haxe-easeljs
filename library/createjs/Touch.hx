/**
 * Global utility for working with multi-touch enabled devices in EaselJS. Currently supports W3C Touch API (iOS and
 * modern Android browser) and the Pointer API (IE), including ms-prefixed events in IE10, and unprefixed in IE11.
 * 
 * Ensure that you {{#crossLink "Touch/disable"}}{{/crossLink}} touch when cleaning up your application. You do not have
 * to check if touch is supported to enable it, as it will fail gracefully if it is not supported.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 *      var stage = new createjs.Stage("canvasId");
 *      createjs.Touch.enable(stage);
 * 
 * <strong>Note:</strong> It is important to disable Touch on a stage that you are no longer using:
 * 
 *      createjs.Touch.disable(stage);
