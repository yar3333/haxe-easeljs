/**
 * A Shape allows you to display vector art in the display list. It composites a {{#crossLink "Graphics"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * instance which exposes all of the vector drawing methods. The Graphics instance can be shared between multiple Shape
 * instances to display the same vector graphics with different positions or transforms.
 * 
 * If the vector art will not
 * change between draws, you may want to use the {{#crossLink "DisplayObject/cache"}}{{/crossLink}} method to reduce the
 * rendering cost.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 *      var graphics = new createjs.Graphics().beginFill("#ff0000").drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
 *      var shape = new createjs.Shape(graphics);
 * 
 *      //Alternatively use can also use the graphics property of the Shape class to renderer the same as above.
 *      var shape = new createjs.Shape();
 *      shape.graphics.beginFill("#ff0000").drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
