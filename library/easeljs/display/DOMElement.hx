/**
 * <b>This class is still experimental, and more advanced use is likely to be buggy. Please report bugs.</b>
 * 
 * A DOMElement allows you to associate a HTMLElement with the display list. It will be transformed
 * within the DOM as though it is child of the {{#crossLink "Container"}}{{/crossLink}} it is added to. However, it is
 * not rendered to canvas, and as such will retain whatever z-index it has relative to the canvas (ie. it will be
 * drawn in front of or behind the canvas).
 * 
 * The position of a DOMElement is relative to their parent node in the DOM. It is recommended that
 * the DOM Object be added to a div that also contains the canvas so that they share the same position
 * on the page.
 * 
 * DOMElement is useful for positioning HTML elements over top of canvas content, and for elements
 * that you want to display outside the bounds of the canvas. For example, a tooltip with rich HTML
 * content.
 * 
 * <h4>Mouse Interaction</h4>
 * 
 * DOMElement instances are not full EaselJS display objects, and do not participate in EaselJS mouse
 * events or support methods like hitTest. To get mouse events from a DOMElement, you must instead add handlers to
 * the htmlElement (note, this does not support EventDispatcher)
 * 
 *      var domElement = new createjs.DOMElement(htmlElement);
 *      domElement.htmlElement.onclick = function() {
 *          console.log("clicked");
 *      }
 * 
 * <strong>Important:</strong> This class needs to be notified it is about to be drawn, this will happen automatically
 * if you call stage.update, calling stage.draw or disabling tickEnabled will miss important steps and it will render
 * stale information.
