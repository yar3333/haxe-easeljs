/**
 * A StageGL instance is the root level {{#crossLink "Container"}}{{/crossLink}} for an WebGL-optimized display list,
 * which is used in place of the usual {{#crossLink "Stage"}}{{/crossLink}}. This class should behave identically to
 * a {{#crossLink "Stage"}}{{/crossLink}} except for WebGL-specific functionality.
 * 
 * Each time the {{#crossLink "Stage/tick"}}{{/crossLink}} method is called, the display list is rendered to the
 * target &lt;canvas/&gt; instance, ignoring non-WebGL-compatible display objects. On devices and browsers that don't
 * support WebGL, content will automatically be rendered to canvas 2D context instead.
 * 
 * <h4>Limitations</h4>
 * - {{#crossLink "Shape"}}{{/crossLink}}, {{#crossLink "Shadow"}}{{/crossLink}}, and {{#crossLink "Text"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * 	are not rendered when added to the display list.
 * - To display something StageGL cannot render, {{#crossLink "displayObject/cache"}}{{/crossLink}} the object.
 * 	Caches can be rendered regardless of source.
 * - Images are wrapped as a webGL "Texture". Each graphics card has a limit to its concurrent Textures, too many 
 * Textures will noticeably slow performance.
 * - Each cache counts as an individual Texture. As such {{#crossLink "SpriteSheet"}}{{/crossLink}} and 
 * {{#crossLink "SpriteSheetBuilder"}}{{/crossLink}} are recommended practices to help keep texture counts low.
 * - To use any image node (DOM Image/Canvas Element) between multiple StageGL instances it must be a 
 * {{#crossLink "Bitmap/clone"}}{{/crossLink}}, otherwise the GPU texture loading and tracking will get confused.
 * - to avoid an up/down scaled render you must call {{#crossLink "StageGL/updateViewport"}}{{/crossLink}} if you
 * resize your canvas after making a StageGL instance, this will properly size the WebGL context stored in memory.
 * - Best performance in demanding scenarios will come from manual management of texture memory, but it is handled
 * automatically by default. See {{#crossLink "StageGL/releaseTexture"}}{{/crossLink}} for details.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * This example creates a StageGL instance, adds a child to it, then uses the EaselJS {{#crossLink "Ticker"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * to update the child and redraw the stage.
 * 
 *      var stage = new createjs.StageGL("canvasElementId");
 * 
 *      var image = new createjs.Bitmap("imagePath.png");
 *      stage.addChild(image);
 * 
 *      createjs.Ticker.on("tick", handleTick);
 * 
 *      function handleTick(event) {
 *          image.x += 10;
 *          stage.update();
 *      }
 * 
 * <h4>Notes</h4>
 * - StageGL is not currently included in the minified version of EaselJS.
 * - {{#crossLink "SpriteContainer"}}{{/crossLink}} (the previous approach to WebGL with EaselJS) has been deprecated.
 * - Earlier versions of WebGL support in EaselJS (SpriteStage and SpriteContainer) had hard limitations on images
 * 	per container, which have been solved.
