/**
 * Display one or more lines of dynamic text (not user editable) in the display list. Line wrapping support (using the
 * lineWidth) is very basic, wrapping on spaces and tabs only. Note that as an alternative to Text, you can position HTML
 * text above or below the canvas relative to items in the display list using the {{#crossLink "DisplayObject/localToGlobal"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * method, or using {{#crossLink "DOMElement"}}{{/crossLink}}.
 * 
 * <b>Please note that Text does not support HTML text, and can only display one font style at a time.</b> To use
 * multiple font styles, you will need to create multiple text instances, and position them manually.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 *      var text = new createjs.Text("Hello World", "20px Arial", "#ff7700");
 *      text.x = 100;
 *      text.textBaseline = "alphabetic";
 * 
 * CreateJS Text supports web fonts (the same rules as Canvas). The font must be loaded and supported by the browser
 * before it can be displayed.
 * 
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Text can be expensive to generate, so cache instances where possible. Be aware that not all
 * browsers will render Text exactly the same.
