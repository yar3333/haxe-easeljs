/**
 * Displays a frame or sequence of frames (ie. an animation) from a SpriteSheet instance. A sprite sheet is a series of
 * images (usually animation frames) combined into a single image. For example, an animation consisting of 8 100x100
 * images could be combined into a 400x200 sprite sheet (4 frames across by 2 high). You can display individual frames,
 * play frames as an animation, and even sequence animations together.
 * 
 * See the {{#crossLink "SpriteSheet"}}{{/crossLink}} class for more information on setting up frames and animations.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 *      var instance = new createjs.Sprite(spriteSheet);
 *      instance.gotoAndStop("frameName");
 * 
 * Until {{#crossLink "Sprite/gotoAndStop"}}{{/crossLink}} or {{#crossLink "Sprite/gotoAndPlay"}}{{/crossLink}} is called,
 * only the first defined frame defined in the sprite sheet will be displayed.
