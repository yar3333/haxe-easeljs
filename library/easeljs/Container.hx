/**
 * A Container is a nestable display list that allows you to work with compound display elements. For  example you could
 * group arm, leg, torso and head {{#crossLink "Bitmap"}}{{/crossLink}} instances together into a Person Container, and
 * transform them as a group, while still being able to move the individual parts relative to each other. Children of
 * containers have their <code>transform</code> and <code>alpha</code> properties concatenated with their parent
 * Container.
 * 
 * For example, a {{#crossLink "Shape"}}{{/crossLink}} with x=100 and alpha=0.5, placed in a Container with <code>x=50</code>
 * and <code>alpha=0.7</code> will be rendered to the canvas at <code>x=150</code> and <code>alpha=0.35</code>.
 * Containers have some overhead, so you generally shouldn't create a Container to hold a single child.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 *      var container = new createjs.Container();
 *      container.addChild(bitmapInstance, shapeInstance);
 *      container.x = 100;
