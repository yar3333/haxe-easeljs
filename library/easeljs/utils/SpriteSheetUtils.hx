/**
* The SpriteSheetUtils class is a collection of static methods for working with {{#crossLink "SpriteSheet"}}{{/crossLink}}s.
*	A sprite sheet is a series of images (usually animation frames) combined into a single image on a regular grid. For
*	example, an animation consisting of 8 100x100 images could be combined into a 400x200 sprite sheet (4 frames across
*	by 2 high). The SpriteSheetUtils class uses a static interface and should not be instantiated.
